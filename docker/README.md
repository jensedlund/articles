# SBTal repo Dockerfiles

This directory holds default Dockerfiles providing images 
that are used in the repos. 

The `template-base`template does not hold any Dockefiles, 
however, since the only image that is needed for all
repos is the standard `sprakbankental/os` SBTal OS 
image which is provided on Docker Hub. See `/docs/README.md` 
for instructions on how to build docs using that image.
